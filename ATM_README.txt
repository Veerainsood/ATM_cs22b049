The code is endowed with a default user whose id is:
User account Number: 1
User account Password: 123
User balance : 100000

we can use the admin account to add money into the atm machine
as well as the admin can change all user details...
Admin User account Number: 9999
Admin User account Password: "Krishna"

Since an atm deals with notes I have added the provision to deal with coins of all denominations:
2000 note
500 note
200 note
100 note
50 note
20 note
10 note
it will show you how much of each note did you withdraw....
enjoy!!
